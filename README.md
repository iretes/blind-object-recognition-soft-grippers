# Blind object recognition with soft grippers

In scenarios where visual feedback is unavailable or unreliable, soft tactile sensing provides crucial information for object identification. Leveraging the compliance of soft grippers enables rich contact signals that can be used to recognize objects by touch alone.

Develop a machine learning pipeline that processes tactile and proprioceptive data from a soft gripper to classify objects. You can choose between using the provided simulation environment or the real-world dataset. The project involves preprocessing time-series, feature extraction, and training classifiers to recognize a set of known objects.

BONUS: Implement few-shot or metric-learning techniques to generalize recognition to new objects with minimal additional samples.
